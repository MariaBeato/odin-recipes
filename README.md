# odin-recipes
In the world of the Vikings there must be a lot of food, so that they can gain strength to carry out their heavy tasks!
I was ordered by the Viking leader "The Odin Project", to make a simple webpage with recipes for them.

## Main purpose
- The main purpose of this webpage is to practice the HTML basics that I learned in "The Odin Project".
