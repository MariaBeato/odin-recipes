    <!-- Description of the recipe -->
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Sawdust pudding, or <em>serradura</em>, is a Portuguese dessert that's perhaps the easiest and best last course ever. 
        It's made by layering crushed tea cookies with sweetened whipping cream. Three ingredients.</p>
    <br>
    
    <!--Ingredients of the recipe-->
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>One (7-oz) package</strong> tea cookies (traditionally Bolacha Maria cookies but Leibnez will work nicely);</li>
        <li><strong>2 cups</strong> heavy whipping cream;</li>
        <li><strong>One (14-oz) can</strong> sweetened condensed milk;</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <!-- Steps of the recipe -->
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In the bowl of a food processor, blitz the cookies into fine crumbs.</li>
        <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whip attachment, beat the cream until medium-soft peaks form, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the milk and fish water, continue stirring until thickened. We want a bechamel consistency.</li>
        <li>Add the sweetened condensed milk and continue whipping until medium-stiff peaks form, 2 to 4 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Spoon the cream into a resealable plastic bag and snip off one of the bottom corners of the bag to make for easy piping.</li>
        <li>In individual glass serving dishes, wine glasses, martini glasses, short Mason jars, or a single large serving dish, alternate layering the cream and the cookie crumbs beginning and ending with the cream. 
            You should have about 7 layers..</li>
        <li>Garnish with anything you desire, whether ground cinnamon, almonds, toasted coconut, or the very untraditional (though stunning) passion fruit pulp and seeds.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate at least 4 hours or preferably overnight to allow the cookies to soften. If chilling overnight, tent the puddings with plastic wrap to avoid it drying out.</li>
        <li>Serve cold and garnish, if desired, with cinnamon, almonds, coconut, and/or passion fruit just before serving.</li>
    </ol>
