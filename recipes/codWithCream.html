    <!-- Steps of the recipe -->
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse and drain the soaked cod, place it in a medium pot, and cover it with hot water. 
            Place it over a medium heat, bring it to a boil, and let it simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain the fish, saving 1 cup of the water.</li>
        <li>In another medium-size pot, combine the butter, flour, and a drizzle of olive oil. Place It over low to medium heat. 
            After the butter has melted, cook the mixture for around 2 minutes, constantly stirring.</li>
        <li>Add the milk and fish water, continue stirring until thickened. We want a bechamel consistency.</li>
        <li>Stir in the fresh cream, season it with nutmeg, salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Place a frying pan over medium heat, add a tbsp of olive oil, the onions and garlic. Fry them till the onions are translucent. 
            Add the fish and fry for another 5 minutes. Transfer it to a mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Cover the bottom of the same frying pan with olive oil. Fry the potatoes in batches, till golden brown. 
            Rest it on some absorbent towels to drain any excessive oil.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 200 Celsius.</li>
        <li>Combine the fish sauce, the potatoes, and the fish. Place it on a baking dish, sprinkle the cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Place it in the oven and roast it for 20 minutes or until the cheese is golden brown.</li>
        <li>Serve sprinkled with some fresh parsley.</li>
    </ol>
